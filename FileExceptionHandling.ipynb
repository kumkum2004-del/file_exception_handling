        "      - The whole program is translated into machine code (binary) before it runs.\n",
        "      - This translation is done by a compiler.\n",
        "      - After compiling, you get an executable file.\n",
        "  - Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "      - Code is read and executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
